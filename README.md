BESL is an online eSports league for competitive tournaments on various games and formats. Everyone can create a team with their fellow friends and sign up for the current season tournament. Skill levels are represented by tiers and range from Open, Mid and Premiership. 

Written entirely in ASP.NET Core MVC 2.2, focusing on good project architecture, easy testability, scalability, CQRS and code quality.
