# ‚öôÔ∏è Local setup
1. Make sure you have the following app secrets set in either the 'Secret Manager' or 'Azure KeyVault' if you decide to deploy this application:
    * Cloudinary:
        - cloudinary-cloud
        - cloudinary-apiKey
        - cloudinary-apiSecret
    * Steam
        - steam-api-key
    * SendGrid
        - sendgrid-api-key

2. Run the following docker command from the root directory of the repository to set up the necessary containers (you could also start the containers in detached mode if you want):
``` 
docker-compose -f docker-compose.Development.yml up
```

üìå __The Web App container is build under the "Development" environment and the developer exception page is enabled. If you manage to get a HTTP 500 response you will be greeted with the stack-trace of the exception.__

3. To shutdown all containers used by the application run the following command from the root directory of the repository:
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.Development.yml down
```
